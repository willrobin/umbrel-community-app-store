# Development

## Requirements
- git
- Optional: `yamllint`
- Optional: python3

## Local Workflow
1) Create a new app scaffold:
   `./scripts/new-app.sh <app-id> "<App Name>"`
2) Edit `apps/<app-id>/umbrel-app.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`.
3) Publish to repo root:
   `./scripts/publish.sh`
4) Validate:
   `./scripts/validate.sh`
5) Commit and push.

## Umbrel App Discovery

**Important:** Umbrel discovers apps from the **repository root**, not from `apps/`.

We use a two-directory workflow:
1. **Development** in `apps/<app-id>/` (source of truth)
2. **Publishing** to `<repo-root>/<app-id>/` via `./scripts/publish.sh`

```
apps/kasa-app/           →  publish.sh  →   kasa-app/
(edit here)                               (Umbrel reads this)
```

**What publish.sh copies:**
- `umbrel-app.yml`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `README.md`

**What stays in apps/ only:**
- `icon.png` (referenced via GitHub URL in manifest)
- Any extra development files

**WARNING:** Never manually edit or delete root-level app directories.
They are auto-generated by publish.sh and should be treated as build artifacts.

## Git Hooks (auto commit messages)
- Enable once per clone:
  `./scripts/setup-githooks.sh`

## Umbrel Store Metadata
- `umbrel-app-store.yml` describes the store itself. It does not list apps.
