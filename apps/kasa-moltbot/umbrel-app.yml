  Moltbot is an open-source personal AI assistant that you operate on your own
  devices. It connects to multiple messaging channels including WhatsApp,
  Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, Matrix, and
  more — all managed through a single Gateway control plane.

  The Gateway is the heart of Moltbot. It manages sessions, channels, tools,
  and events via WebSocket, giving you full control over your AI assistant
  across all connected platforms. A built-in WebChat and Control UI let you
  interact directly from your browser.

  Moltbot supports Anthropic Claude and OpenAI models with automatic failover,
  browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol, voice interaction through
  ElevenLabs, and a flexible plugin system for extending functionality.

  Features include multi-channel messaging, voice interaction, live Canvas
  workspace, browser control, DM pairing for secure access, and a powerful
  agent mode for autonomous task execution.
