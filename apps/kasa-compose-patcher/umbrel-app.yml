  Compose Patcher is a tool for umbrelOS that automatically restores custom
  changes to Docker Compose files when Umbrel app updates overwrite the
  configuration.


  Every time an app is updated, Umbrel resets the docker-compose.yml. If you
  have added custom volumes, devices, environment variables, or other
  modifications, they are lost. Compose Patcher solves this problem with
  declarative patch rules that are applied idempotently and automatically
  after every update.


  Features include a web UI for managing patch rules per app, a diff view
  (baseline vs. current), dry-run simulation, automatic backup and validation
  before every change, and a systemd-based filesystem watcher that detects
  changes immediately.


  Compose Patcher consists of two components: a host daemon running as a
  systemd service that executes the patch logic, and this Umbrel app as a
  graphical interface for management and monitoring.
